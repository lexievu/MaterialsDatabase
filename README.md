# MaterialsDatabase

## Aim

The code aims to study the magnetic properties of materials by automated search. The code is divided into three main parts: 

### 1. Doc_Processing

This folder contains code pertaining to 

* Recognising chemical formulae
* Recognising temperature 
* Recognising length 
* Extracting the Curie temperature, Neel temperature and helical pitch from a file

### 2. Utility

This folder contains code pertaining to 

* Reading a material database, containing chemical formulae and structural informations such as space group 
* Plotting histograms and scatter graphs 

### 3. Webscraping

This folder contains code pertaining to 

* Getting information from Elsevier API, provided that one has an API key 
* Getting information from Springer API, provided that one has an API key
* Getting information from an URL 
* Getting information from Google Scholar
